# APB Slave Verification Project

This repository contains my graduate-level verification project for an **APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) Slave interface** using **UVM** and **Mentor Graphics QuestaSim**.

The goal was to verify that the APB Slave module correctly responds to read and write transactions initiated by an APB Master, in compliance with the AMBA APB protocol specification.
This was used in our soc project.
